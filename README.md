# Welcome! 

This is the challenge at the bottom of the desktop-first approach setcion of the User Centric Frontend Development module. Instructions are to:

- Make the section full height
- Remove margins and paddings from body and html elements

This project has been lightly extended to:

- Add a header to the page
- Reduce the section height to 50% for screens below 992px wide (so it's more obvious that the desktop-first approach is being used)
- Use CSS3 calc() and viewport height units for sizing the sections to allow for vertical resizing
- Add explanations of functionality within the body section
- Adjust CSS slightly to clean up the look of the page

Notice the use of the `max-width` media query as opposed to `min-width`.
